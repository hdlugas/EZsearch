# JOSS_TBD
Command-line Python tool to perform spectral library matching to identify compounds with host of preprocessing transformations and silmilarity measures

# Insert instructions for creating environment ...

# Usage
This repository has two main capabilities:
1. running spectral library matching to identify compounds based off of their mass spectrometry data
2. plotting a query spectrum vs a reference spectrum before and after preprocessing transformations.

These tasks are implemented separately for the cases of (i) GCMS and (ii) LCMS data due to different spectrum preprocessing and mass:charge ratios in GCMS vs LCMS data.
