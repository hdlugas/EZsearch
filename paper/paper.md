# Summary

A primary goal of the field of Metabolomics - i.e. the qualitative and quantitative study of metabolites - is to identify chemical compounds in a given sample, oftentimes with the motivation of identifying/quantifying biomarkers for use in diagnosing, treating, and/or stratifying the risk of some disease. A central tool for compound identification in Metabolomics is mass spectrometry which produces a finite set of points - termed the mass spectrum - in the plane $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for a given chemical compound with each point representing an ion fragment, one axis representing mass/charge, and the other axis representing intensity. The primary method used to identify a given unknown chemical compound based off of its mass spectrum is termed 'spectral library matching' and involves computing a measure of similarity between the mass spectrum of the unknown chemical compound and each mass spectrum of chemical compounds in a predetermined reference library. The unknown chemical compound is then identified as the chemical compound from the reference library whose mass spectrum is most similar to the mass spectrum of the unknown chemical compound. We present EZsearch, a command-line tool written in Python implementing spectral library matching with a host of spectrum preprocessing transformations and similarity measures available in addition to being able to analyze both of the two main types of mass spectrometry data: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data.

# Statement of need

There exist several open-source software tools for working with mass spectrometry data. The Python package 'matchms' allows one to perform spectral library matching and provides an API for users to define their own spectrum preprocessing transformations and similarity measures [@Huber2020]. The C++ library 'OpenMS' and its Python wrapper 'pyOpenMS' are for analyzing LC-MS data and provide common spectrum preprocessing transformations such as filtering based on mass/charge and intensity values [@Rost2014; @Rost2016]. The Python package 'spectrum_utils' provides functionality for preprocessing and visualizing mass spectrometry data [@Bittremieux2020]. The R package 'metID' is a tool for LC-MS-based compound identification with a focus on allowing users to combine their in-house database(s) with public databases [@Shen2022]. The R Shiny package 'ShinyMetID' provides users six similarity measures (Cosine, Weighted Cosine, Stein & Scott, Discrete Fourier Transformation, Discrete Wavelet Transformation, and Semi-Partial Correlation) and a graphical user interface to perform spectral library matching to identify chemical compounds based off of GC-MS data [@Jeong2023]. 

In a GC-MS experiment that uses a single instrument, the resulting data have a fixed number of mass/charge values for all chemical compounds, whereas in an LC-MS experiment, the mass spectrum of one chemical compound often has a different number of mass/charge values than another mass spectrum corresponding to a different chemical compound. This results in several spectrum preprocessing steps unique to LC-MS data analysis compared to GC-MS data analysis, namely centroiding (i.e. merging peaks that are 'close' with respect to their mass/charge values) and matching (i.e. aligning the mass/charge values in such a way that we obtain a list of intensities \emph{of the same length} from each spectrum). In addition to these canonical spectrum preprocessing transformations, weight factor transformations and low-entropy transformations have been proposed to improve the performance of compound identification [@Kim2012; @Li2021]. Additionally, the Shannon Entropy Similarity measure has recently been proposed to outperform the Cosine Similarity Measure with respect to LC-MS-based compound identification [@Li2021]. In EZsearch, we provide a Python-based command-line tool allowing the user to perform spectral library matching on either GC-MS or LC-MS data with options to construct their own spectrum preprocessing pipeline from the spectrum preprocessing transformations we found in the literature. Additionally, EZsearch allows the user to choose among four similarity measures: the commonly-used Cosine Similarity Measure [@Stein1994], the recently-proposed Shannon Entropy Similarity Measure [@Li2021], the recently-proposed Tsallis Entropy Similarity Measure (add citation for our recent submission to Analytical Chemistry?), and the novel RÃ©nyi Entropy Similarity Measure. 



# Functionality
## Spectrum Preprocessing Transformations
Functionality implementing the following spectrum preprocessing transformations is offered in EZsearch:

* Filtering: Given user-defined parameters (mz_min,mz_max), (int_min,int_max) and spectrum $I$ with mass/charge values $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$ consists of the points $(m_{i},x_{i})$ in $I$ such that mz_min $\leq m_{i}\leq$ mz_max and int_min $\leq x_{i}\leq$ int_max.

* Weight Factor Transformation: Given a pair of user-defined weight factor parameters $(\text{a,b})$ and spectrum $I$ with mass/charge values $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$ has the same mass/charge values as $I$ and has intensities given by $I^{\star}:=(m_{1}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{1}^{\text{b}},m_{2}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{2}^{\text{b}},...,m_{n}^{\text{a}}\cdot x_{n}^{\text{b}})$.

* Low-Entropy Transformation: Given a user-defined low-entropy threshold parameter $T$ and spectrum $I$ with intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, then the transformed spectrum intensities $I^{\star}=(x_{1}^{\star},x_{2}^{\star},...,x_{n}^{\star})$ are such that, for all $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$, $x_{i}^{\star}=x_{i}$ if $H_{Shannon}\geq T$ and $x_{i}^{\star}=x_{i}^{\frac{1+H_{Shannon}(I)}{1+T}}$ if $H_{Shannon}\textless T$.

* Centroiding (only applicable to LC-MS data): Given a user-defined window-size parameter $w_{centroiding}$ and a spectrum $I$ with mass/charge values $(m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{n})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, the transformed spectrum $I^{\star}$ merges adjacent points $(m_{i},x_{i}),(m_{i+1},x_{i+1})$ into the point $(\frac{m_{i}\cdot x_{i}+m_{i+1}\cdot x_{i+1}}{x_{i}+x_{i+1}},x_{i}+x_{i+1})$ if $|m_{i}-m_{i+1}|\textless w_{centroiding}$ for $i\in\{1,2,...,n-1\}$. This centroiding procedure generalizes to more than two points whose mass/charge values are within distance $w_{centroiding}$ of each other.

* Noise Removal: Given a user-defined noise removal parameter $r$ and a spectrum $I$ with intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$, noise removal removes points from $I$ with $x_{j}\textless r\cdot\text{max}(\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\})$ for $j\in\{1,2,...,n\}$.

* Matching (only applicable to LC-MS data): Given a user-defined window-size parameter $w_{matching}$ and two spectra $I$, $J$ with mass/charge ratios $(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}), (b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{m})$ and intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}), (y_{1},y_{2},...,y_{m})$, respectively, of which we would like to measure the similarity between, the matching procedure outputs two spectra $I^{\star},J^{\star}$ containing the same number of points with $I^{\star}$ and $J^{\star}$ having transformed intensities and identical mass/charge ratios. Specifically, for a given point $(a_{i},x_{i})$ of $I$, if there are no points $(b_{j},y_{j})$ in $J$ with $|a_{i}-b_{j}|\textless w_{matching}$, then the point $(a_{i},x_{i})$ remains in $I^{\star}$ and the point $(a_{i},0)$ is included in $J^{\star}$. If there is at least one point $(b_{j},y_{j})$ with $|a_{i}-b_{j}|\textless w_{matching}$, then the point $(a_{i},x_{i})$ remains in $I^{\star}$ and the point $(a_{i},\sum_{j}b_{j})$ is included in $J^{\star}$. This procedure is applied when transposing the roles of $I$ and $J$ as well.

* Normalization: Prior to computing entropy - regardless of whether in the context of performing the low-entropy transformation or computing an entropy-based similarity score - the intensities of each spectrum must be normalized to sum to 1 in order to represent a probability distribution. To normalize a given spectrum $I$ with intensities $(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})$ into spectrum $I^{\star}$ with intensities $(x_{1}^{\star},x_{2}^{\star},...,x_{n}^{\star})$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{\star}=1$, two methods are offered:

  ** Standard: $x_{i}^{\star}=\frac{x_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}$.
  
  ** Softmax: $x_{i}^{\star}=\frac{e^{x_{i}}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{x_{i}}}$ where $e\approx 2.72$ is Euler's constant.


## Similarity Measures
Given a pair of processed spectra intensities $I=(a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}), J=(b_{1},b_{2},...,b_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with $0\leq a_{i},b_{i}\leq 1$ for all $i\in\{1,2,...,n\}$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}=1$, EZsearch provides functionality for computing the following similarity measures:

* Cosine Similarity Measure:
\begin{equation*}
    S_{Cosine}(I,J)= \frac{I\circ J}{|I|_{2}\cdot |J|_{2}}
\end{equation*}
where multiplication in the numerator refers to the dot product $I\circ J=a_{1}b_{1}+a_{2}b_{2}+...+a_{n}b_{n}$ of $I$ and $J$ and multiplication in the denominator refers to multiplication of the $L^{2}$-norm of $I$ and $J$, $|I|_{2}=\sqrt{a_{1}^{2}+a_{2}^{2}+...+a_{n}^{2}}, |J|_{2}=\sqrt{b_{1}^{2}+b_{2}^{2}+...+b_{n}^{2}}$.

* Shannon Entropy Similarity Measure:
\begin{gather*}
    S_{Shannon}(I,J) = 1-\frac{2\cdot H_{Shannon}\left(\frac{I+J}{2}\right) - H_{Shannon}(I)-H_{Shannon}(J)}{ln(4)},\\
    H_{Shannon}(I)=-\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}\cdot ln(p_{i})
\end{gather*}

* Tsallis Entropy Similarity Measure:
\begin{gather*}\label{eq:tsallis}
    S_{Tsallis}(I_{q},I_{l},q)=1-\frac{2\times H_{Tsallis}(I_{Q}/2+I_{L}/2,q)-H_{Tsallis}(I_{Q},q)-H_{Tsallis}(I_{L},q)}{N_{Tsallis}},\\
    N_{Tsallis}:==\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(2\left(\frac{a_{i}}{2}\right)^{q}+2\left(\frac{b_{i}}{2}\right)^{q}-a_{i}^{q}-b_{i}^{q}\right)}{1-q},\\
    H_{Tsallis}(I,q)=\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{q}\right)-1}{1-q},\\
    q\neq 1, \ q\textgreater 0
\end{gather*}

* RÃ©nyi Entropy Similarity Measure:
\begin{gather*}\label{eq:renyi}
    S_{Renyi}(I_{Q}, I_{L})=1-\frac{2\times H_{Renyi}(I_{Q}/2+I_{L}/2,q)-H_{Renyi}(I_{Q},q)-H_{Renyi}(I_{L},q)}{N_{Renyi}},\\
    N_{Renyi}:=\left(\frac{1}{1-q}\right)\left(2\times ln\left(\sum_{i}(a_{i}/2)^{q}+\sum_{j}(b_{j}/2)^{q}\right)-ln(\sum_{i}a_{i}^{q})-ln(\sum_{i}b_{i}^{q})\right),\\
    H_{Renyi}(I,q)=\frac{1}{1-q}ln(\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{q}),\\
    q\neq 1, \ q\textgreater 0
\end{gather*}

# Usage
This repository has two main capabilities:
1. running spectral library matching to identify compounds based off of their mass spectrometry data
2. plotting a query spectrum vs a reference spectrum before and after preprocessing transformations.

These tasks are implemented separately for the cases of (i) GCMS and (ii) LCMS data due to the different spectrum preprocessing transformations stemming from a different format in the mass:charge ratios in GCMS vs LCMS data. To see all parameters for any of the four main scripts (spec_lib_matching_lcms.py, spec_lib_matching_gcms.py, plot_spectra_lcms.py, plot_spectra_gcms.py), run:
